# Understanding Python Basics

## Introduction
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It is widely used in various fields, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. In this lesson, we'll cover the fundamental concepts of Python programming, including syntax, data types, and control flow.

## Getting Started

To start programming in Python, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: [https://python.org](https://python.org).

Once installed, you can write and run Python code using:
- The Python interactive shell (`python` or `python3` command)
- A code editor like VS Code or PyCharm
- Online editors like Replit or Google Colab

## Python Syntax

Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define blocks of code instead of curly braces or keywords.

Example:
```python
if True:
    print("This is indented and will run.")
```

### Comments
Comments start with a `#` symbol:
```python
# This is a comment
```

### Variables
Variables are used to store data. You don’t need to declare their type explicitly.
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
is_student = True
```

## Data Types

Common Python data types include:

| Type      | Example              |
|-----------|----------------------|
| String    | `"Hello"`            |
| Integer   | `10`                 |
| Float     | `3.14`               |
| Boolean   | `True`, `False`      |
| List      | `[1, 2, 3]`          |
| Tuple     | `(1, 2, 3)`          |
| Dictionary | `{"name": "Alice"}` |

## Control Flow

Control flow allows you to execute different code depending on conditions or loop through code multiple times.

### If Statements
```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

### Loops

**For Loop:**
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

**While Loop:**
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we introduced the basics of Python programming: syntax, variables, data types, and control flow. These are the building blocks of Python, and mastering them will prepare you for more advanced topics such as functions, modules, and object-oriented programming.
